    Do you remember the realms you resided in? / They sit silent / never decaying / unlike your memories dispersing into / recollection and myth //
    <i>City of Heros </i>/ <i>Star Wars Galaxies </i>/ <i>The Matrix Online </i>/ <i>Asheron's Call</i>// 
    you look on them fondly / but forget how you lived fully//
    you became a poet / to forever inscribed these realms / you thought would never disappear, // 
    but have you taken a look at your Notes App lately? / the words linger between the digital seams / next to heartbreak trying / to feel your fingers / for a //
    remember that Tumblr diary / the Twitter page with your jokes / the HTML code describing your "under construction" / aren't you still under construction, / 'til every cell dies and is replaced / but that's an automatic process //
    so you say / we live in a saturated market, how will anyone ever make it? / bullshit / to justify your disappearence / your trepidation. / Someone will always take your place / make the website, the video-- become viral, and / defile your future aesthetic // 
    and defile the could-ofs with an "I'm sorry / when they were found messaging minors their sexual fanatsies // no, it's not your fault you lack / the resolve to continue / the game was rigged from the start / rigged to stop you from living free // 
    but today is the day to start over. / Write those peoms! / Record those videos! / Live as an artist / in those resided realms / and breath live into the structures abandoned / the resbonsibility to breath life into the past / is on you. //
